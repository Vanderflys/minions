To check the items that the minion has generated for you simply right-click on them.<br>
To claim the items, shift right-click on the minion.<br>
To remove the minion, shift left-click on the minion.<br><br>

To get enchanted items, drop a stack of 64 of the same material on the ground and it will<br>
transform into the enchanted version of that item.<br>

To upgrade minions, drop 64 of the enchanted material that the minion gathers on the minion<br>
and it will automatically upgrade after that.<br>
